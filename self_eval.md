1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?

Very confident

1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
I spent ~2 hours on the actual writing statements and code. However, I ended the assignment rather late past the time estimate because I didn't understand the formatting in VS code. I struggled to see where I needed to type my answers, and why my terminal was outputting everything in the document, and how to fix that by commenting out what I didn't need in the moment. I spent about 70% of my overall time on that in particular, and I reached out for help.

1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I am now more comfortable with the formatting of these assignments. I will do more preparation the night before so that I can be prepared for that stuff going into the assignments for tomorrow.

1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
For further formatting and understanding that may come up again, I will reach out sooner to my classmates.
